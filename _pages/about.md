I am an undergraduate student at Hendrix College studying Computer Science and Studio Art. I'm interested in how novel user interfaces and designs can be used to transform how people think about programming languages. I particulaly want to explore how ideas about art and aesthetics can be used to encourage new ways of learning and thinking. I also enjoy printmaking, photography, and [transformative generative art](/projects/flowfield-portraits).

What I'm currently thinking about:

 - Educational game design
 - Blogging and digital gardening
